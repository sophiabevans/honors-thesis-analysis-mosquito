Data, experimental design, and analysis for undergraduate honors thesis "Iron Tolerance in Blood-Feeding vs. Obligate Non-Biting Populations of the Pitcher Plant Mosquito, Wyeomyia smith"

data: csv files containing counts of pupae, pupae eclosion dates and sex, adult death dates and sex, egg counts, and hatched egg counts from treatment groups.

experimental design and analysis is detailed in "Sophia Bevans Experiments II.docx". This experiment was designed by Dr. William Bradshaw and Dr. Christina Holzapfel. I performed this experiment in their laboratory of evolutionary genetics at the University of Oregon. 

A replication of my original analysis and figures can be found in the file thesis_data_analysis. The data used in the analysis is the original data collected for my honors thesis. 

"SophiaBevansThesis.pdf" is my final thesis document which was accepted by the department of Biology at the University of Oreogn in January 2020.
